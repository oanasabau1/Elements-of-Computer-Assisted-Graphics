# Elements-of-Computer-Assisted-Graphics
This repository contains the laboratory work at Elements of Computer Assisted Graphics during the semester to keep track of my work.

Laboratory 6 contains the Cohenâ€“Sutherland algorithm for line clipping.
The Cyrus-Beck algorithm also for line clipping is containd in Laboratory 7. 
In Laboratory 8, I implemented the Bresenham's line algorithm.
